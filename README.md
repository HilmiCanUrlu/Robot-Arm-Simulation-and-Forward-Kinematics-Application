# Robot-Arm-Simulation-and-Forward-Kinematics-Application
This project is a Tkinter-based robot arm simulation that calculates forward kinematics for a two-link arm. Users can adjust arm lengths, set target coordinates, and customize the animation's speed and colors. The simulation visually animates the arm's motion and ensures error handling for unreachable targets.
